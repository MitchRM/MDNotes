# Useful Git command line interpreter commands when developing robot software 
These commands can be executed from the terminal in VS Code - very handy.
- git branch - shows branches in the repo
- git switch "branch-name" - moves focus to branch-name
- git config user.name - Shows the user name associated with the repo. This is the user that will be listed when changes are merged with the origin on Github.
- git config user.email - Shows the repo user email
- git switch -c "branch-name" : creates new branch (from the branch you are in?)
