    * Elevator Absolute Encoder (AE)
        * Purpose is to provide an absolute elevator position measurement that can be used to calibrate the motor internal relative encoders.
        * During 2025 Comp the AE output was not scaled - so it is in encoder revolutions. There is an offset configuration that sets the AE to zero at the lowest elevator position. So calibration of the motor encoders had to be done at the lowest position. The encoder output wrapped to zero every revolution. [CHECK THIS]
