# Process Notes 
1. I had looked at NoteHub - which is an interesting note taking app that is capable of using iCloud and git to manage and synch notes. But looks like it might be fiddley and a distraction. 
2. So now I'm going to give it a try to just use git and GitHub. At least I'll be practicing skills that translate to programming. I'll use VS Code for interfacing to GitHub. I plan to try using One Markdown for modifying individual files.
3. Running a test of a local git - GitLocal in Documents on Driver Station
4. Working on MacBook logged out of Github. I added this line and commited with Github Desktop 
5. Now I'm adding more and I'm going to commit in VS Code with git enabled.
