# Process Notes 
- I had looked at NoteHub - which is an interesting note taking app that is capable of using iCloud and git to manage and synch notes. But looks like it might be fiddley and a distraction. 
- So now I'm going to give it a try to just use git and GitHub. At least I'll be practicing skills that translate to programming. I'll use VS Code for interfacing to GitHub. I plan to try using One Markdown for modifying individual files.
- Running a test of a local git - GitLocal in Documents on Driver Station
- Working on MacBook logged out of Github.
