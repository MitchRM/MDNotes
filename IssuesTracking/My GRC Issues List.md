# My GRC Issues List 
30Apr25

Thoughts on the team’s issues list based on what I’ve been seeing:
- It isn’t helpful to put a students name on an issue - they ignore it, do not take responsibility, and it makes it an assignment that they don’t want to do. Remember this isn’t a paying job.
- Maybe better to document:
  - What the issue is
    - Why it’s important
    - When does the solution need to be implemented
    - What skills will it develop
    - What makes it fun
    - Recent status update
- We want the list to be something a student would feel free to modify. Maybe a way for them to propose additions or changes. So maybe could have official list in github (or somewhere) and then use Slack as a place to collect information to be entered by mentor or student leader. (The latest official version could be posted on slack before or after each meeting?)
