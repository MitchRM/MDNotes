# My GRC Issues List

Thoughts on the team’s issues list based on what I’ve been seeing:
-   It isn’t helpful to put a students name on an issue - they ignore it, do not take responsibility, and it makes it an assignment that they don’t want to do. Remember this isn’t a paying job.
-   Maybe better to document:
    -   What the issue is
    -   Why it’s important
    -   When does the solution need to be implemented
    -   What skills will it develop
    -   What makes it fun
    -   Recent status update
